* ir1-grapher
  This library graphs SBCL [[https://cmucl.org/docs/internals/html/The-Implicit-Continuation-Representation.html#The-Implicit-Continuation-Representation][ir1]] and outputs graphviz.

  Here's an [[./example-out.svg][example]] .svg file showing a render of the component
  created when compiling ~(defun foo () (+ 1 2))~.

  As of now, it is stil unfinished. In particular, I don't have proper
  output of all the node types that SBCL uses, and the interface is
  not clean.

** How do I use it?
   Right now, there is no real user-facing interface. As I've been
   debugging, I've been hooking ~sb-c::compile-component~ with the
   ~defhook~ macro that I defined in ~ir1-grapher.lisp~ and simply
   grabbing the components that creates, and then calling ~(save-graph
   *graph* #p"./whatever.dot")~.
